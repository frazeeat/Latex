Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking is a process in which to pump gas, or oil out of shale rocks. Fracking has pros and cons associated with it. Some pros are covered in the article written by Hassett and Mathur published authors in the \textit{Oxford Energy Forum}, where they go over the benefits that fracking has done to our economy. On the other side we have Hofman a geologist from Montana State University talking about how fracking can negatively effect the environment.
